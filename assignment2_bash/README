Here is the script bash/python script that takes list of hostnames (comma separated) as an argument.
This script, when executed, will connect to all the servers via. SSH (standard port) (assumeed password-less connectivity) and give a single prompt to the user.
When the user executes a command on this prompt, the script should run the command on all connected servers and display the output.

Make the script Executable:

chmod 777 script.sh

Now run the script along with the arguments

./script.sh host1,host2

NOTE: Hostname should have DNS entry or host file entry.
