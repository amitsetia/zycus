Dockerfile (CentOS 6) to install the following in a Docker continer:
Python 2.7
MongoDB - any version
Apache tomcat 7 - running on port 8080

run the Dockerfile such that once the container boots, apache tomcat's home page is accessible from the host on port 7080.
##Note: Make sure that you have docker installed on your machine

Run Dockerfile on to your machine where you have docker installed.

#this command will build the image with name of centos-tomcat7/avani

RUN : docker build -t centos6/tomcat7
After the image is built , run the container

RUN : docker run -itd -p 7080:8080 centos6/tomcat7
Once we run these commands we can access tomcat7's home by going to ip:7080

Also, we can execute the container and check the version of mongodb and python

RUN : docker exec -it ID_OF_DOCKERCONTAINER /bin/bash
To check version :

mongod --version

python2.7 --version
